Project Proposal:

My project "Joke Generator" is a simple web application that makes use of 
an external data, a JSON file with a collection of jokes to display random
jokes in the browser upon a click of a button. The program makes use of a JavaScript
with one function that fetch a json data accross the internet and manipulate
the DOM to display random jokes. There is also a CSS that makes the HTML visually
appealing.

Files:
jokes.html
jokes.css
jokes.js
