Better options for the fol loop. Arry.forEach
or Array.map are usually better options if 
you are looping over an array(which you often are). 

For-In 
This form of loop allows you to iterate over 
objects. It returns the key of the item 
instead of the value like for of. 

While 
while is greate for when you need 
to do something until a certian state occurs 
in your program. You know when you wnat the
loop to end...but aren't sure how many loops
it will require to get there.
